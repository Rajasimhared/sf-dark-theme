# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

This preference is synchronized across your devices if you're logged into Chrome, but is never sent to any external servers.

## Permissions

- **storage**: Used to save your dark mode preference
- **activeTab**: Used to apply dark mode to the current tab
- **host_permissions (<all_urls>)**: Required to apply dark mode to all websites you visit

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the extension listing.
